### PickYourStay - Booking App using MERN Stack:

# Project Overview:
The project, called PickYourStay, is a hotel room booking application. It allows users to register, post their accommodations (such as hotels or resorts), and view and book stays listed by others.

# User Registration and Authentication:
Users can sign up and create accounts within the app. For authentication, the system checks if the email is registered, and upon successful login, a token is generated. This token is stored in browser localStorage and is used to authenticate users for actions like booking stays and uploading accommodations.

# Listing Accommodations:
Registered users can list their properties, such as hotels, resorts, or any type of accommodation. They have the option to upload accommodation photos either via:

> Photo links (using the Cloudinary library)
> Direct file uploads (using multer)

# Booking Process:
Users can browse through available accommodations, view details, and book their preferred stay through the app.

# Frontend:
The frontend of the app is built using React.js, with Tailwind CSS for styling and creating a user-friendly interface.

# Backend:
The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic, routes, and APIs.

# Data Storage:
The application stores data using MongoDB, which manages user information, accommodation details, bookings, and more.
